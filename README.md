# Redux Feedback Loop
In this project, I created a feedback form modeled after Prime Digital Academy's daily feedback system. Feedback is collected over four views. In a separate review page, the current feedback values are displayed along with a submit button. When all steps are complete, the app saves the feedback in the database. All of the existing feedback is viewable at the route `/admin`.

## Installation
* `npm install`
* In separate Terminal tabs `npm run client` and `npm run server`

## Technologies Used
Redux Feedback Loop used the following technologies: React, React-Redux, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS for styling.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis and my classmates in Prime's Porta cohort for teaching me the technologies needed to make this project in a very short amount of time.
